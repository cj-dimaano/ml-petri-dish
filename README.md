# ML Petri Dish

This project is primarily meant to be a personal exercise in learning various technologies.  The
final product should be a simple simulation of at least one creature moving around collecting some
kind of resource.  The creature(s) should be controlled by an AI that utilizes some technique of
machine learning.

## Build and Run

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is needed to transpile the code which depends on
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

Make sure you have NodeJS installed.

```bash
$ node -v
v8.*.*
```

```bash
$ npm -v
6.*.*
```

While in the project root directory, install project dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the project.

```
$ npm run build
```

Open `./dist/index.html` to see the simulation.

> Testing is exclusively performed on Google Chrome.
